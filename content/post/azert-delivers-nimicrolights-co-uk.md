I have created a new website for local microlight training school [NiMicrolights.co.uk](www.nimicrolights.co.uk).

A full write up of the project can be found over at the project page via the following [link](/project/nimicrolights-website/) . This was a really enjoyable project for me, aircraft and flying being a real passion of mine. I managed this entire project in the evenings over about 5 nights, not bad I don't think!

It is built using the same tech stack as this blog:

*   Hugo
*   Forestry.io
*   GitHub Pages

This stack is such a breeze to use I'm hoping to use it in many more projects in the future. Do get in touch if there is a web project you'd like to discuss!
